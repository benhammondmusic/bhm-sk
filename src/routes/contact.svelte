	<h2>Booking</h2>
	<p>
		As a solo artist, I specialize in destination weddings and other intimate events. Often
		incorporating loop pedals and extended performance techniques, I truly enjoy providing the
		energy and variety of a full band or DJ with the pricing and space considerations of a single
		performer. If a more intricate production is in your plans, I also work with an amazing
		assortment of band members including horns, strings, percussion, and much more.
	</p>

	<p>
		My performances are improvised and passionate, shaping themselves in real-time to suit you and
		your guests, whether that be a romantic ceremony, relaxing over cocktails, or dancing the night
		away! My services are well suited for clients who are passionate about live music, and who are
		seeking a fun and memorable way to enhance their celebration. Wherever you might be in your
		planning, please <a href="mailto:hello@benhammondmusic.com">email for more info </a>. Let's make
		some music!
