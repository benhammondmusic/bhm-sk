<h1>Booking</h1>
<p>
	As a solo artist, I specialize in destination weddings and other intimate events. Often
	incorporating loop pedals and extended performance techniques, I truly enjoy providing the energy
	and variety of a full band or DJ with the pricing and space considerations of a single performer.
	If a more intricate production is in your plans, I also work with an amazing assortment of band
	members including horns, strings, percussion, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	My performances are improvised and passionate, shaping themselves in real-time to suit you and
	your guests, whether that be a romantic ceremony, relaxing over cocktails, or dancing the night
	away! My services are well suited for clients who are passionate about live music, and who are
	seeking a fun and memorable way to enhance their celebration. Wherever you might be in your
	planning, please <a href="mailto:hello@benhammondmusic.com">email for more info, or receive a
	custom quote by filling in my <a href="contact.html#dubsado_lead_capture">event form. Let's
	make some music!
